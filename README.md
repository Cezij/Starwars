# Starwars Mod
It's going to be released on 28.8.22!
In the End dimension you can find either a Jedi or a Sith temple, which both contain a Kyber crystall, an item that allows you to craft lightsabers. All crafting recipies will be uploaded. If you want to be a Jedi /trigger Jedi and if you want to be a Sith /trigger Sith. There are also blasters, that you can find in the temples, and their ammo are arrows, you can put "INFINITY" enchantment on a blaster, and you will need only 1 arrow for shooting with it. There will be updates so stay tuned (secret enchantments...no spoilers!).
